#### Create a new ReactJS Application

In this task, you will create a React application and deploy it to the Cloud using AWS Amplify.
AWS Amplify offers a Git-based CI/CD workflow for building, deploying, and hosting single-page web applications or static sites with backends. When connected to a Git repository, Amplify determines the build settings for both the frontend framework and any configured backend resources, and automatically deploys updates with every code commit.

In this task, you will start by creating a new React application and pushing it to a GitHub repository. You will then connect the repository to AWS Amplify web hosting and deploy it to a globally available content delivery network (CDN) hosted on an amplifyapp.com domain.

### 1. Create a new React application

Step 1: Open you file explorer, create a new folder name it <<Your-Project-Amplify>> and open Visual Studio Code with the folder created open terminal in VS Code run the following command to create a new React application using Vite and React:

```bash
npm create vite@latest profilesapp -- --template react
cd profilesapp
npm install
npm run dev

```

Step 5:
Open your source code initilized in the previous step, right click on the `profilesapp` and click `Open in Intergrated Terminal`, and run the following commands to initialize a git and push of the application to the new GitHub repository:

    git add .
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/profile_app
    git branch -M main

    git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Install the Amplify packages

1. Open a new terminal window, navigate to your app's root folder (profilesapp) open in Intergrated Terminal above by right click on file _package.json_, purpose is navigate correctly to root folder, and run the following command:

**Run the following command to install the Amplify CLI:**

```bash
npm create amplify@latest -y

```

2. Running the previous command will scaffold a lightweight Amplify project in the appâ€™s directory.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Amplify installed"
git push
```

If you have successfully pushed the changes to GitHub, you will see the following message in the terminal:
